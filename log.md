# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 12-6-FRI

**Today's Progress**: Started HarvardX's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. Also continuing with the book "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way." 

**Thoughts:** I started learning to code a few months ago, but this is the beginning of a dedicated, accountable learning effort. I want to build a solid foundation, but think CS50 might be a bit innefective for my project. I'll stick with it for now, but I need to focus on Python for data science more than web development.
