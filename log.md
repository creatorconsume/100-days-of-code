# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 12-6-FRI

**Today's Progress**: Started HarvardX's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. Also continuing with the book "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way." 

**Thoughts:** I started learning to code a few months ago, but this is the beginning of a dedicated, accountable learning effort. I want to build a solid foundation, but think CS50 might be a bit innefective for my project. I'll stick with it for now, but I need to focus on Python for data science more than web development. 

### Day 2: 12-7-SAT

**Today's Progress**: Continued HarvardX's CS50 Intro to Comp Sci class. Started server project. Signed up for service, learning how to build a server.

**Thoughts:** I had doubts about the CS50 class, but not anymore. The professor's enthusiasm is contagious, and the first principles approach to computer programming is exactly what I've needed to fill in my patchy understanding of computer science and programming. I've been having a lot of trouble with setting this server up. Many sites are blocked, so I'm always having to navigate that issue. In a way, programming has been teaching me to get over my frustrations. There will always be problems with my code, and I will always be problem solving, so I need to force myself to feel calm when things go wrong.

## Day 3: 12-8-SUN ##

**Today's Progress**: Finished first lecture, HarvardX CS50 Intro to CompSci. Finished building my server.

**Thoughts**: It felt great to finish the server and have it up and running successfully. The programs that I needed to install on it are all working perfectly. I'm loving the Intro to CompSci class and finding it useful. The #100DaysOfCode public challenge has helped me to stay accountable to myself and to the public, even though I don't really have any followers.
