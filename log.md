# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 12-6-FRI

**Today's Progress**: Started HarvardX's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. Also continuing with the book "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way." 

**Thoughts:** I started learning to code a few months ago, but this is the beginning of a dedicated, accountable learning effort. I want to build a solid foundation, but think CS50 might be a bit innefective for my project. I'll stick with it for now, but I need to focus on Python for data science more than web development. 

### Day 2: 12-7-SAT

**Today's Progress**: Continued HarvardX's CS50 Intro to Comp Sci class. Started server project. Signed up for service, learning how to build a server.

**Thoughts:** I had doubts about the CS50 class, but not anymore. The professor's enthusiasm is contagious, and the first principles approach to computer programming is exactly what I've needed to fill in my patchy understanding of computer science and programming. I've been having a lot of trouble with setting this server up. Many sites are blocked, so I'm always having to navigate that issue. In a way, programming has been teaching me to get over my frustrations. There will always be problems with my code, and I will always be problem solving, so I need to force myself to feel calm when things go wrong.

### Day 3: 12-8-SUN 

**Today's Progress**: Finished first lecture, HarvardX CS50 Intro to CompSci. Finished building my server.

**Thoughts**: It felt great to finish the server and have it up and running successfully. The programs that I needed to install on it are all working perfectly. I'm loving the Intro to CompSci class and finding it useful. The #100DaysOfCode public challenge has helped me to stay accountable to myself and to the public, even though I only have a handful of followers. 

### Day 4: 12-9-MON 

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with second lecture, HarvardX CS50 Intro to CompSci. Decided first project.

**Thoughts**: I'm planning my first real programming project: A Linux desktop app that displays the current English Premier League table. I'm not sure how to build a GUI, or how to write the backend of an app like this, but I'm interested in the project and that will push me to learn.

### Day 5: 12-10-TUE 

**Today's Progress**: Gave up on HarvardX CS50 for now. Planning Structure of EPL Desktop App.

**Thoughts**: I gave up on the CS50 class for a few reasons. First, I felt like I was spending too much time watching the lectures, and not enough time actually programming. After I watched the lectures, I still had to go through and teach myself the code for the homework. It would have been more effective for me to skip the lectures, and just go straight to the homework. The second reason I quit is that I'm not currently interested in learning HTML or C or C++. I just want to stick to Python, as I need it for my master's thesis to do data analysis. 

It was a great lecture, and I wish I had time to spend with it, but I don't. I think I'll watch the lectures as entertainment when I'm washing dishes or relaxing, so I can still get some use out of them. 

I plan to use QTIO for the GUI on my English Premier League (EPL) table project. It looks like I'll be able to design the app graphically, and convert that into code. I like this approach. I don't want to have to fiddle with numbers to move symbols around and position them on the screen. I'd rather design a GUI by looking at it than writing code. I will still learn the code, and the future will tell if this is a smart approach. Right now I'm going with it, and it may be a mistake, but at least I'm moving towards the goal.

### Day 6: 12-11-WED 

**Today's Progress**: Finished 10 exercises in "Learn Python the Hard Way". Had a final exam.

**Thoughts**: I should figure out how to add my coding examples to Github. "Learn Python the Hard Way" has great exercises.

### Day 7: 12-12-THU 

**Today's Progress**: A crucial plugin stopped working after some updates. Still haven't found a fix. Got through exercises 11 to 14 in "Learn Python the Hard Way" and started reading "Think Python". 

**Thoughts**: "Think Python" has already improved my attitude about debugging. It seems like a great book so far. I'm finding it hard to commit to any one textbook. I need to find one book that I can stick to and complete, while treating "Learn Python the Hard Way" as a supplemental exercise book. I’m finding it difficult to plan my coding journey too far out into the future, since I’m always finding ways to improve my plans.

### Day 8: 12-14-SAT 

**Today's Progress**:  Fixed plugin. Read “LPtHW”, Did exercises from “Think Python”.

**Thoughts**: Skipped Friday. Too busy to log. Did a bit of reading but not much. Today I continued “Think Python” and did some basic exercises.

### Day 9: 12-15-SUN 

**Today's Progress**: Today was challenging. Didn’t understand how functions reference each other, themselves and call arguments. “Think Python” wasn’t helping my understanding here.

**Thoughts**: I need to schedule my programming times better. I have a feeling that if I did this in the morning, I would have been able to understand this problem better.

### Day 10: 12-16-MON 

**Today's Progress**: Functions are clearer. Installed PYQT5. Will start designing desktop app soon. Started reading “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”.

**Thoughts**: I understand functions now thanks to a YouTube video and accompanying Jupyter notebook. Also got a clearer understanding of Jupyter notebooks today.   

“Automate the Boring Stuff with Python” (AtBSwP) has great examples and the book explains concepts explicitly and plainly in a language that’s easy for me to grasp. I think it’s still important to continue with “Think Python” though, since that book is tailored towards developing a programmer’s mindset.

Found an issue with my epub copy of “Think Python.” The publisher has a free PDF on his website, but I prefer to use epubs so I can take notes in Google Play Books. Found an epub copy on Github, but when I upload it to Google Books it’s missing some text. I guess I’ll just use the PDF version. 

### Day 11: 12-17-TUE 

**Today's Progress**: Found a website with free soccer data for my desktop app: http://football-data.org
- Continuing to appreciate "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".

**Thoughts**: I was excited to find a great dataset in football-data.org. Looking forward to using it tomorrow

### Day 12: 12-18-WED 

**Today's Progress**: Learning about APIs. Focusing on getting data from football-data.org

**Thoughts**: Used this website to learn APIs: https://realpython.com/python-requests/#getting-started-with-request


### Day xx: xx-xx-xx
